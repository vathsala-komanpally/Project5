        <h1>Today's Recipe:</h1>
        <p>Ingredients: <br/>
        1/2 cup cream cheese <br/>
        11/2 tbs pure icing sugar <br/>
        1 lemon, zested <br/>
        1 cup plain flour <br/>
        1 cup caster sugar<br/>
        1/4 cup cocoa, plus extra to dust<br/>
        1 tsp baking powder<br/>
        150g unsalted butter, melted<br/>
        1/2 cup milk<br/>
        2 free range eggs<br/>
        1 tsp vanilla extract<br/>
        125g raspberries, plus extra to serve<br/>
        2 tsp red food colouring<br/>
        200g 70% cocoa dark chocolate, chopped<br/><br/>
        Method: <br/>
        1. Combine cream cheese, icing sugar and zest in a bowl and chill until required.<br/>

        2. Place flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, butter, milk, eggs, vanilla, 
        raspberries, food colouring, pinch of salt and half the chocolate in a blender and process for 1 minute or until smooth.<br/>

        3. Divide mixture evenly between 4 x 400ml-capacity mugs until three-quarters full. 
        Top each with remaining chocolate and 11/2 tbs water. Place onto a plate and 
        microwave for 2 minutes or until puddings have risen â€“ they will still be soft in the centre.
         To serve, top with cream cheese mixture and extra raspberries, and dust with extra cocoa.<br/>
        tip: preparation time + chilling time.
